# 2048-clone
Clone of the game 2048. Developed in Python as part of the Rice University course 'Principles of Computing' on Coursera.org.

The game can be run by visiting http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user45_s1gqoMvbwNQcFDj_0.py and clicking the 'play' button at the top.

The size of the board can be changed by updating line 186 by updating "board = TwentyFortyEight(4, 4)" to 'TwentyFortyEight(rows, cols)'.
